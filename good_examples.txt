# Good Escalation Examples

## Overview

This file includes good examples of effective escalations that follow the best practices described in the content standards.

By providing sufficient data, analysis, reproduction steps, and contexts, the development/engineering team can quickly and seamlessly triage the case and start investigating the problem.

Also, consistently creating high-quality escalations helps the support team maintain good relationships with the development/engineering team.

## Good Example 1
**Title:** US Region - Users Cannot Login

**Priority:** P1 (URGENT/CRITICAL)

**Description:**
The customer reported that end users cannot log in to our platform. They input username and password and pressed the "Login" button, but the page didn't change at all.
I've attached the screen recording they shared with me (login_error.mov).
It was a US-based customer and I could reproduce the issue on my US testing environment while another environment in the EU region works fine.
I inspected the network logs on the browser and found the /login endpoint returned status code 500 (attached as network_logs.har). The reproduction rate was 9 out of 10 tries. I got one successful login, but the server took 5 seconds until it navigated me to the next screen.
The customer stated that they started to see the issue from 2025-07-01 00:10:00 UTC.
The access logs show the number of successful login attempts is sharply decreasing starting from the time the customer reported: https://example.com/logs?from=20250701001000&to=20250701011000&type=login&result=success
Could you assemble the team and initiate the incident response process? I believe this is a P1 incident as all US customers could be potentially impacted.

**Reproduction Steps:**
- Have an account for the US region and try to login.

## Good Example 2
**Title:** "Desktop SDK: ERROR CODE 0100" when running Web SDK in specific environment

**Priority:** P3 (NORMAL)

**Description:**
The customer reported that our SDK for web applications displays a console.error log "Web SDK: ERROR CODE 0100abc" in the browser's web inspection tool console.
Reportedly, they only see this log on Mac OSX + Safari environment. As the message "ERROR CODE 0100" is not informative, they wanted us to help them understand what was going wrong. 
I created a small testing application using our public sample repository (https://example.com/quickstarts/our-web-sdk) and ran it on my Mac + Safari. I could not reproduce the problem. However, the customer could reproduce the message when they ran my testing application on their laptop.
The customer shared the screen recording and console outputs (see screen_recording.mov and console_logs.jpeg)

When we compared the OS and browser versions, there were some differences. I guessed these differences in the versions were the cause of the error message.

**Their environment:**
- Mac OS Sonoma 14.x, Intel Chip
- Safari 18.4

**My environment:**
- Mac OS Sequoia 15.x, Apple M2
- Safari 18.5

I searched for this error code "0100abc" in the SDK's source code, but there was no exact match. However, the error message clearly states "Web SDK." I believe the message was generated by our Web SDK.
Could you help me understand what the error message "Web SDK: ERROR CODE 0100abc" mean so the customer and I evaluate the potenaital impact of this error?
