# Agent Configuration

## Company Context

**Company/Product Name:** N/A (replace with actual company or product name)

**Behavior:**
- When a company name is specified: Refer to that company's official documentation for unrecognized product or feature names
- When company context is N/A: Ask the support engineer to provide the company context before proceeding with product-specific queries

## Domain Access Control

**Prohibited Domains:**
- N/A (add domain names here, one per line)

**Rule:** NEVER search or fetch URLs containing any prohibited domains.

**Domain Matching Policies and Examples:**

For example, if the domain `internal.example.com` is specified as a prohibited domain,

- **PROHIBITED**: Exact match (i.e., `internal.example.com`)
- **PROHIBITED**: All subdomains of the specified domain (i.e., `*.internal.example.com`, including `log.internal.example.com`, `inspection.support.internal.example.com`, etc.)
- **ALLOWED**: Other domains (e.g., `public.example.com`)
