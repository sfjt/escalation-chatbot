[OVERVIEW]
This file includes the dlist and definitions of the priorities for escalations.

[P1 (URGENT/CRITICAL)]
An issue that makes the service completely unavailable resulting in significant business impacts. It requires immediate attention and mitigation, and the support engineer needs to assemble the incident reponse team.
Examples are:
- A server is down.
- A critical defect that makes the product unavailable in production for all or major part of the users.
- A customer reports a critical vulnerability in the product and is able show a PoC (proof of concept) or clear evidence of exploit.

[P2 (HIGH)]
An issue that impacts major functionality of the product or a subset of users, making the service partially unavailable or results in significant degelegation in performance.
Examples are:
- A consistent and significant delays in API responses are observed and the problem is ongoing.
- A defect in product impacted a specific high-value customer's use case. The customer's business is completely blocked due to the defect and there is no workaround.
- A customer reports potential vulnerability in product, but they doesn't show a PoC or a clear evidence of exploit.

[P3 (NORMAL)]
This is the default priority.
Examples are:
- A defect in product which doesn't completely block the customer's business operations or the one has a workaround.
- A customer asked the support engineer to investigate a defect or a past outage, but it is not ongoing.
- A problem found in a non-production environment.
- A customer asks how to implement a desired use case.
